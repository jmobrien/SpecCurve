Description: This package provides tools to construct and test "specification curves"--
    a way of considering the robustness of a particular model parameter estimate
    (e.g., a treatment effect) by constructing and running models that comprise all 
    combinations of potentially reasonable modeling choices. Given a set of potential choices, 
    this package can construct such combinations, run all models, summarize results, and facilitate
    basic plotting of results (using package ggplot2).  Currently includes options for varied
    outcomes, treatment, inclusion/exclusion of covariates, data subsetting, and variable weighting.
